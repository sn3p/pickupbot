# Pickupbot for UT99

mIRC Pickupbot for Unreal Tournament 99.  
Originally created for Project F.R.A.G. by MoehMan ([v1.6d](https://github.com/sn3p/pickupbot/releases/tag/1.6d)).

I've added some features that rely on [Mavericks IRC Reporter Gambino Edition](https://github.com/sn3p/MvReporter):

- Automatically set the server map when a game starts.
- Automatically reset the server password after a game has finished.
